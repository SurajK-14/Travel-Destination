    Deep Blue: 
        Use a deep, rich blue color (such as #003366) as the primary color. This shade of blue can symbolize the vastness of the ocean and create a sense of calmness and tranquility.
        Earthy Green: Complement the deep blue with an earthy green color (such as #009933). This shade of green represents nature and can be associated with lush landscapes, forests, and vibrant vegetation.
        Warm Neutrals: Incorporate warm neutrals like light beige (such as #F5F5DC) and sandy brown (such as #D2B48C) to provide a backdrop that resembles sandy beaches, deserts, and natural elements.
        Vibrant Accents: Add pops of vibrant accent colors to bring energy and excitement to the website. Consider using shades of coral (such as #FF7F50) or turquoise (such as #40E0D0) to represent tropical destinations and the vibrant colors often found in travel photography.
        Crisp White: Use a clean, crisp white (such as #FFFFFF) for backgrounds or text to provide contrast and ensure readability.
        This color scheme aims to create a visually appealing and immersive experience that reminds users of their travel aspirations. Remember to use colors in moderation, focusing on the main content elements and keeping the overall design balanced.
